<p>\
  Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the Western \
  United States.\
</p>\
<p>\
  Wyoming is the 10th most extensive, but the least populous \
  and the second least densely populated of the 50 United \
  States. The western two thirds of the state is covered mostly \
  with the mountain ranges and rangelands in the foothills of \
  the eastern Rocky Mountains, while the eastern third of the \
  state is high elevation prairie known as the High Plains. \
  Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, \
  with a population estimate of 63,624 in 2017.\
